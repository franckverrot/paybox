Paybox
======


Installation (Rails 3)
----------------------

In your Gemfile :

    gem 'paybox'


Todo
----

Lots of improvements can be made:

* Add I18n
* Tests
* Documentation
* ...

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
-----------------------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
